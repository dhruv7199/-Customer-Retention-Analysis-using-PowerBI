# -Customer-Retention-Analysis-using-PowerBI

Introduction: Customer retention is a critical component of any business strategy. Retaining existing customers is typically more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Therefore, it is important to analyze customer data and identify factors that influence customer retention. This project aims to use PowerBI to perform a customer retention analysis for a company, identify key factors that influence customer retention, and generate insights that can be used to improve customer retention.

Task Performed: To complete the analysis, the following tasks were performed:

  1.Found total revenue and loss
  2.Analyzed average monthly charges by gender
  3.Identified customers with or without partners
  4.Found the number of senior citizens in the customer base
  5.Analyzed customer churn or retention based on contract type (month-to-month, one-year, two-year), monthly tenure, payment method, phone service, multiple lines,         internet service, online security, tech support, streaming TV, and movies
  6.Identified the number of open admin and tech support tickets

Methodology: The methodology used in this project involved collecting data from the company's database and importing it into PowerBI. The data was cleaned and transformed to ensure its accuracy and consistency. The data was then visualized using various charts and graphs in PowerBI to generate insights.

Results: The analysis revealed several insights that can be used to improve customer retention. Some of the key findings include:

1. Increase tech support capacity for Fiber Optic customers and lower tech tickets per customer to 0.5
2. Increase sales of 1 and 2-year contracts by 5% each
3. Yearly increase of automatic payments by 5%

Conclusion: In conclusion, the customer retention analysis project using PowerBI was successful in identifying key factors that influence customer retention. The insights generated can be used by the company to develop retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction. The project demonstrates the importance of data analysis in making informed business decisions.
